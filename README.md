# Homework 10 (The Last One!)

Everything this week is working with GIS content. In the zip file `prob1_data.zip` are two files:
* `cities.csv` - A spreadsheet of all the cities in the world with populations over 1000
* `country_info.csv` - A spreadsheet of the corresponding country information for all countries

There is also an included data dictionary with information about the various columns in both tables:
* `data_dict.md` - A breakdown of the columns present in each table

You will need to import the information from both `*.csv` files into your database, but to save you the issue of having to name all your columns, I have also included `create_tables.sql` which you can run or copy from to generate your initial tables.

The zip file `us_counties_2010.zip` is actually a Shapefile which contains the county polygons of all counties in the United States. You will need to unzip and then import that information into your database to answer the extra credit problem.
